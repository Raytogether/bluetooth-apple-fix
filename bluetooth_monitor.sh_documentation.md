# Bluetooth Monitor Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a robust Bluetooth monitoring and auto-recovery solution for Apple Bluetooth devices, which often encounter issues on Linux systems. The solution includes a comprehensive monitoring script and an automated test suite.

## Key Components

### 1. Bluetooth Monitor Script (bluetooth_monitor.sh)
A comprehensive script that:
- Detects Apple Bluetooth hardware
- Monitors Bluetooth service status
- Checks hardware functionality 
- Identifies common failure modes
- Implements multiple recovery strategies
- Maintains logs of actions and status

### 2. Test Suite (run_tests.sh)
A comprehensive test suite that:
- Uses mock commands to simulate system behavior
- Tests command-line options
- Tests hardware detection
- Tests service management
- Tests power management
- Tests recovery mechanisms
- Provides detailed reporting of test results

## Implementation Process

### Initial Problem Identification
- Identified intermittent Bluetooth disconnection issues with Apple devices
- Determined that power management settings were causing device resets
- Found that the Bluetooth stack wasn't properly recovering after failures

### Solution Development
1. Created a monitoring script to detect issues
2. Implemented tiered recovery strategies:
   - Power management settings adjustment
   - Service restart
   - USB device reset
   - Module reload
   - Specialized Broadcom reset procedures
3. Added persistent settings via udev rules
4. Implemented comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Testing Framework
- Created a test harness with mock system commands
- Developed assertions for validation
- Implemented realistic simulation of system behavior
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all components

## Running the Solution

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/bluetooth-apple-fix.git
cd bluetooth-apple-fix
chmod +x src/bluetooth_monitor.sh
chmod +x tests/run_tests.sh
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the monitor in the background
./src/bluetooth_monitor.sh &

# Run with verbose logging
./src/bluetooth_monitor.sh --verbose

# Check status once without continuous monitoring
./src/bluetooth_monitor.sh --once

# Run specific recovery actions
./src/bluetooth_monitor.sh --full-recovery --once
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cd bluetooth-apple-fix
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

## Future Improvements
- Add more device-specific detection and recovery methods
- Implement a systemd service for proper system integration
- Create a configuration file for customization
- Add a simple UI for status monitoring
- Integrate with desktop notification systems

## Session History
This project was developed through a collaborative Warp AI session on April 8, 2025. The session included:
- Initial problem analysis and solution planning
- Script implementation and testing
- Test suite development
- Debugging and refinement
- Documentation creation
