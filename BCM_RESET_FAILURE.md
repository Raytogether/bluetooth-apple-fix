# Broadcom BCM Bluetooth Reset Failure Documentation

## 1. Overview and Problem Description
This document details a critical issue affecting Apple Bluetooth controllers using Broadcom BCM chipsets where the controller experiences reset failures. The issue manifests as a timeout during the controller initialization process, potentially impacting Bluetooth functionality on affected systems.

## 2. Affected Hardware
- Broadcom BCM Bluetooth Controller
  - Chip ID: 102
  - Build: 0730
  - Product ID: 05ac:8294 (Apple-specific implementation)
  - Features: 0x2f

## 3. Symptoms and Log Analysis
The primary symptom is a reset failure during Bluetooth controller initialization. Key log indicators include:

```
[   76.779466] Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x0c03 tx timeout
[   76.779506] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: Reset failed (-110)
```

The failure sequence typically follows this pattern:
1. Initial controller detection and setup
2. Command timeout during initialization
3. Reset failure with error code -110

## 4. Technical Details
The initialization sequence, as observed in the logs:

1. Initial chip detection:
```
Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 102 build 0730
Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: product 05ac:8294
Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: features 0x2f
```

2. Core system initialization:
```
Bluetooth: Core ver 2.22
NET: Registered PF_BLUETOOTH protocol family
Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized
Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized
Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized
```

3. Reset failure occurs during controller initialization:
```
Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x0c03 tx timeout
Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: Reset failed (-110)
```

## 5. Root Cause Analysis
The reset failure (error -110) indicates a timeout during the execution of HCI command 0x0c03 (Reset Command). This typically occurs due to:

1. Controller firmware not responding within the expected timeframe
2. Communication issues between the host system and the Bluetooth controller
3. Potential firmware state inconsistencies during initialization

The error code -110 corresponds to ETIMEDOUT in Linux systems, suggesting the controller failed to acknowledge the reset command within the system-defined timeout period.

## 6. Current Monitoring Solution
A monitoring and recovery service (bluetooth-monitor.service) is implemented to:

1. Continuously monitor Bluetooth controller status
2. Detect reset failures and other anomalies
3. Attempt recovery when issues are detected
4. Log all events for diagnostic purposes

The service is configured with:
- Automatic startup on system boot
- 60-second monitoring intervals
- Verbose logging for detailed diagnostics
- Output directed to /var/log/bluetooth-monitor

Example monitoring output:
```
INFO [2025-04-10 15:41:32]: Bluetooth is working properly
VERBOSE [2025-04-10 15:41:32]: Check #1 completed, sleeping for 60 seconds...
```

Note: This documentation is part of the bluetooth-apple-fix project which aims to address and mitigate Bluetooth issues on Apple hardware running Linux systems.
